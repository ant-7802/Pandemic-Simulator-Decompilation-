# Pandemic-Simulator-Decompilation-
I have like 2 more minutes help

alright gamers so my parents bouta wake up and I just decompiled pandemic simulator and this does work (unlike other games) I tested it in its own directory (may be a problem) but alright gamers just try it out see if it works also it needs to be hosted on a web server but thats common knowledge to you hopefully


edit:
How to fix the blocked error (or how to prevent it in the future)

first what you want to do is go into the c2runtime file then you want to search for
"//html5.api.gamedistribution.com/main.min.js" then once you find it remove the entire line
